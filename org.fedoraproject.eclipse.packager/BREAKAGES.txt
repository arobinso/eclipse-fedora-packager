What breaks when upgrading from 0.1.x to 0.2.x:

1.) Filtering of context menu items (for Eclipse Fedora Packager) is done
    based on the existence of a persistent property. I.e. it will not show up
    for old clones. Deleting old clones and doing fresh clones are highly
    recommended.
2.) What else?
