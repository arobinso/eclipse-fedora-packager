Eclipse Fedora Packager NG
--------------------------

This is a total rewrite of Eclipse Fedora Packager. The current version of this
tool is located at http://fedorahosted.org/eclipse-fedorapackager.


What is Eclipse Fedora Packager?
--------------------------------

Eclipse Fedora Packager is a set of Eclipse plug-ins to support Fedora
packagers in their task of packaging RPMs for Fedora. It provides an RPM spec
file editor and various other tools to interact with Fedora infrastructure such
as Koji and Bodhi.

Since this is a rewrite almost from scratch it is not recommended to use it
until further notice. The old version of this tool is shipped with Fedora since
F14. Maybe this will replace it some day.
